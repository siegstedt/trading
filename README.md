# trading

The repo's title follows the essence of this project: engaging in trading. To be more precise, algorithmic trading, or trade bots.

If you want to use this code to get rich, 
I cannot discourage you enough from that idea. 
Simple reason is that it has not worked yet.

So don't be foolish. There is no way to predict the market!

## aim

- bots run in a fully automated system
- bots take various data sources into account
- bots predict the market using advanced analytics
- bots trade autonomously
- bots make a ton of money

## content

So far, the work is on operating trade bots on two different platforms. One for stock trading through the popular platform Interactive Brokers (or "ibkr" for short), and one for crypto trading through the Binance platform (find the folder "binance").
