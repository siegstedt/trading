# My first IB algorithmic trading project

Hi,

welcome to my first algorithmic trading project. There are quite a few points on the ageda for the project.

In a nutshell, I want to design and deploy trading strategies on Interactive Broker's platform. 

The aim is to automate every step of your strategy including, extracting data (stock data and fundamental data), performing technical/fundamental analysis, generating signals, placing trades, risk management etc. 

As a broker at the back of the system, Interactive Brokers will serve me with their Python-wrapped API access.
